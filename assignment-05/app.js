//Question # 1

//1. Write a program that take two numbers & add them in a
//new variable. Show the result in your browser.

//let num1 = 3
//let num2 = 5
//let sum  = (num1 + num2 )
//document.write(`Sum of  ${num1}  and ${num2} is ${sum}`);

//Question # 2

//2. Repeat task1 for subtraction, multiplication, division &
//modulus.


//let number1 = 3
//let number2 = 5
//let subtract  = (num1 - num2 )
//document.write(`Subtraction of  ${number1}  and ${number2} is ${subtract}`);

//let dataNum1 = 3
//let  dataNum2 = 5
//let multiplication  = ( dataNum1 * dataNum2 )
//document.write(`Multiplication of  ${dataNum1}  and ${dataNum2} is ${multiplication}`);

//let data1= 3
//let  data2 = 5
//let division  = ( data1 / data2 )
//document.write(`Division of  ${data1}  and ${data2} is ${division}`);

//let value1= 3
//let  value2 = 5
//let modulus  = ( value1 % value2 )
//document.write(`Modulus of  ${value1}  and ${value2} is ${modulus}`);

//Question # 4

//4. Cost of one movie ticket is 600 PKR. Write a script to
//store
//ticket price in a variable & calculate the cost of buying 5
//tickets
//to a movie. Example output:

//let ticket= 600
//let  quantity = 5
//let  totalCost  = (  ticket * quantity  )
//document.write(`Total cost to buy 5 tickets to a movie is ${totalCost}PKR`);

//Question # 5

let num1 = 4
let one = 1
let multiply = 4 * 1 

let num2 = 4
let two = 2
let multiply2 = 4 * 1 

document.write( `${num1} x ${one} = ${multiply}
    
    ${num2} x ${two} = ${multiply2}`)
